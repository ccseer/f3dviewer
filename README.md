# f3dviewer

A lightweight 3D viewer and Seer plugin based on [F3D SDK](https://github.com/f3d-app/f3d).

This project demonstrates how to embed the F3D engine into a Qt application using an external OpenGL window.  
It also serves as a practical sample for integrating F3D into other applications.


## Features

- Embedded F3D external window inside a Qt `QOpenGLWindow`
- Compatible with most 3D file formats supported by F3D


## Build

### Requirements

- Qt 6.x (Widgets + OpenGL)
- F3D SDK (version 3.0.0 or later)
- CMake 3.16 or newer

### Setup

1. **Download F3D**  
   
   Download the latest release of F3D SDK from:  
   ðŸ‘‰ [https://github.com/f3d-app/f3d/releases](https://github.com/f3d-app/f3d/releases)

2. **Modify `CMakeLists.txt`**  
   
   Edit the `CMakeLists.txt` file and set the correct path to your local F3D installation

3. **Build the project**
